  "name": "Uspomene na \"Crevnu zastavu\"",
  "description": "The writer Milovan Mračević is primarily a historian who dramatically shapes his research. In the case of Remembrance of the \"Red Flag\", he consciously opens his historically accurate work to interpretation and reading, which largely depends on memory. Of course, depending on the age of the participants and observers, those memories are original or secondary, retold, anecdotal, and above all unreliable. As such, they paradoxically question historical facts and impose conclusions about our not-so-distant past, based on the understanding of our present. And that present is primarily colored by existential fears from which, at least in this play, we offer refuge in the deceptive comfort of nostalgia.",
